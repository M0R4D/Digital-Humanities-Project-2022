# Digital Humanities Project Proposal 2022
Hello everyone, my name is ***```Morad Abu Alkeaan```***, I'm a senior CS student @BGU - BenGurion University of the Negev.  
This is my **Digital Humanities** course's final project proposal, you can find the project details and requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vs0ImzfW34KB-kB08xKGqYXh2Ww3q1IFXuMBQCE11KE/edit#) (in Hebrew).

## 1. Target: 

Studying the effect of increasing movie budgets on achieving high revenues.  

## 2. Background: 

Today's world is driven by money, as it is the main engine of everything that is happening around us, and for its sake, neighbors fight and enemies reconcile, wars take place and peace treaties are signed.  
The impact of money is not limited to countries or large companies, but goes beyond that and reaches small enterprises, start-ups and even individuals, and because the field of human sciences primarily examines the impact of certain phenomena on the behavior, behavior and attitudes of human beings, for all these reasons I chose in this project to examine the impact of money in The field of entertainment, specifically cinema, and how the cinema industry is moving from entertainment to a profitable industry in the first place.  

### Project Research Question:

## 3. Work Plan:  

During the **"Digital Humanities"** course, we were directed to some sources related to the field of cinema that contain information on everything related to movies.  
Therefore, my plan to work on this project is as follows:  
1. to rely on these sources, and other sources on the Internet, such as movies databases and archives of international cinema that contain the required information about movies such as the year of release, profits, budget revenues, actors, producer, director, production studio, awards achieved by the movie, if any, etc...  
Our collected data will be JSON files and CSV files and sometimes we will deal with XML files and other formats.  
2. After collecting the information, we do some processing on the existing data and turn it into data that can be used in this project.  
3. After preparing all the required things and processing the data, we extract the results and display them on a website that enables its visitors to view the most successful movies in a particular year (for example, the most successful 20, 50 or 100 movies in a year) with displaying some information about them such as budgets, profits and some other information..  
4. We present the results of the research and examine the impact of the increase in budgets over the years and whether it is a prerequisite for the commercial success of the movie and achieving huge profits and revenues.  
These results will be presented in charts. These charts display the average budgets of the movies we have chosen during a particular year, the average revenue of these movies during the years, and a study of the rise or fall in budgets that occurred over the years, as well as the study of the effect of the amount of money on profits.  

## 4. Expectations: 

We expect that money has a direct impact on the success or failure of the movies, even we think it is a main reason for judging the movie in advance. The requirements for the success of the movies these days depend directly on spending money, such as:  

- good actors
- beautiful animation and sound effects
- filming and production equipments   

All of them need money, and the more you pay, the higher quality you get. This increases the chances of the movie being successful.  
So we think that the charts of the project results will be monotonically increasing functions, evn though we think that they going up very fast.
